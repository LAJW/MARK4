# F# Monogame (XNA) Boilerplate

## Dependencies:

### Windows 
 - Visual Studio 2019
 - .NET Framework 4.7.2
 - Monogame Content Pipeline 3.7.1 http://community.monogame.net/t/monogame-3-7-1-release/11173 - contains a tool for managing all game resources - images, meshes, audio, etc. Monogame is included in the project, but you won't be able to build the assets file and run the game without this.

### Linux (Untested, used to work not that long ago)

 - Monogame Content Pipeline 3.7.1 http://community.monogame.net/t/monogame-3-7-1-release/11173

## Running

 - F5 in Visual Studio
